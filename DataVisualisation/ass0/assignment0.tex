\section{Introduction}
My name is Robert Fels and I'm from Potsdam, Germany. In 2007 I began my studies in computer science at the \textit{Freie Universit√§t Berlin (FU) } and I finished my B.Sc. in 2012. My thesis topic was about offline route planning on mobile devices and extracting various traffic signs out of the OpenStreetMap \footnote{For more information see: \url{www.openstreetmap.org} } which can influence the quality of the routes a vehicle should take. During my bachelor studies I've been on an student exchange once already. It took place in Uppsala, Sweden and I took computer science courses there and learned the Swedish language. After my graduation I decided to work. At first I worked in a company which was developing various programs written in Java only. One of the projects was a huge meteorology framework to visualize a lot of meteorologic data from all over the world. My task was rather to extract and process the data than in visualizing it. After 1 year I was working in a company which was working mainly with embedded systems for ships. The programming language I was using was C++ and the Qt-framework to develop graphical user interfaces and various displays for ships. This year in April I decided to start my masters in computer science at the \textit{FU Berlin} and began another student exchange in August 2014. In terms of knowledge of visualization I heard a Computer Graphics course in Uppsala and gained some knowledge in my companies I worked before. But the knowledge in visualization is based on theoretical knowledge. I haven't used visualization tools in an extensive practical manner. That's what I expect to get from this course - getting to know more about visualization techniques and apply these techniques thoroughly.
